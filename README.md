# HackShield

## Project Overview
HackShield is a cybersecurity learning platform where I learn how attackers think and how to defend systems. The goal is to build an insecure system, learn how it gets hacked, identify vulnerabilities, and then fix them properly.

**Core Principle:** Learn how crimes happen so you can prevent them.

## Why This Project Matters
Without security awareness:
- Apps leak sensitive data
- Systems get breached
- Businesses lose customer trust

HackShield teaches:
- How attacks actually happen
- How to prevent security breaches
- How to design secure systems from the start

## Ethical Hacking Rule 
**IMPORTANT:** Hacking is only legal when:
- You own the system
- You have explicit permission

This project focuses on:
- Learning and education
- Defense and protection
- Ethical responsibility

**Any misuse is strictly forbidden.**

## Features

### Implemented (Week 1)
- GitHub repository setup
- Security mindset framework established
- Basic system understanding documented
- Attack surface mapping

### Planned
- Build vulnerable web application
- Identify security weaknesses
- Practice ethical exploitation (in controlled environment)
- Fix vulnerabilities
- Implement monitoring and alerts

## Tech Stack
**Week 1 (Conceptual Only):**
- **Operating System:** Linux (to be installed later)
- **Web Technologies:** HTML, backend servers
- **Security Tools:** Scanners, logs (to be learned later)

**Current Focus:** Understanding concepts before tools

## HackShield Learning Cycle
This is the process I'll follow throughout the project:

1. **Build** - Create a vulnerable application
2. **Identify** - Find security weaknesses
3. **Exploit** - Test vulnerabilities safely
4. **Fix** - Patch the issues
5. **Monitor** - Set up alerts and logging

## Project Status
- **Current Week:** Week 1
- **Completed:** Security mindset foundation, environment setup planning
- **In Progress:** Understanding attacker vs defender thinking
- **Next:** System mapping, security awareness exercises

## Week 1 Focus: Security Mindset
This week is NOT about hacking tools. It's about:
- Understanding what cybersecurity actually means
- Learning why systems get hacked
- Understanding basic computer and web concepts
- Developing an attacker-vs-defender mindset
- Preparing for ethical hacking responsibly

## Learning Journey
All weekly progress, concepts learned, and security insights are documented in the `docs/` folder.
